            Create subscriptions for private channels
            By default, private channels aren't displayed in the channel selector in the subscription creation dialog. However you can create a subscription for any private channel that you have access to by typing /bitbucket connect <repository URL> within that channel.

                Create personal subscriptions
                You can also have notifications sent to you by direct message from the Bitbucket Slack bot. To create a personal subscription click on the Bitbucket bot in the Apps section of your Slack's left sidebar, and send it the message /bitbucket connect <repository URL>.

                    Set notifications for each subscription
                    After you've installed the app you can choose specific notifications in the settings for each repository. You can even select specific branches to get notifications from so you only get what you want in your channels.

                    Open one of the repositories you connected to Slack.
                    Click Settings then select Chat notifications > Settings.
                    Select a specific branch, set a branch pattern, or select repository wide to get notifications for all branches.
                    Note: It can be helpful to select specific notifications for specific branches. For example you might not want notifications for every commit from every branch but might want exactly that for your production branch.
                    Select the notifications you want for the branch or branches you select.
